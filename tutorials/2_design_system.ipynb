    "Recall from [Intro](./0_intro_to_mode_based_imaging.ipynb) that we measure diagonal components of $U \\left[ \\int \\Gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{K} \\right] U^\\dagger$. By designing the $U$ matrix, we can optimize observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of designing $U$ is through the design of the photonic lantern itself. The lantern's transfer matrix depends on the lantern's waveguide geometry. Another way is to introduce interference between lantern outputs, which can be done through a photonic integrated circuit (PIC).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how the lantern observables change with the choice of the lantern transfer matrix, and illustrates how to design PIC in the `PLsim` framework."
