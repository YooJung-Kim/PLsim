# PLsim

PLsim is a python package for simulating photonic lantern (+ photonic integrated circuit) observables for astronomical scenes.

* For numerical simulation studies on using photonic lanterns for spectroastrometric measurements, please refer to [Kim et al. JATIS 10, 045001](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024JATIS..10d5001K/abstract).

* For laboratory spectral characterizations of standard 3-port photonic lanterns, please refer to [Kim et al. JATIS 10, 045004](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024JATIS..10d5004K/abstract).

The codes for photonic integrated circuit are currently under development for open-use!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YooJung-Kim/PLsim.git
cd PLsim
pip install -e .
```

## Tutorials

Please see [tutorials.ipynb](./tutorials.ipynb) for detailed examples and usage instructions.
