# PLsim

PLsim is a python package for simulating photonic lantern (+ photonic integrated circuit) observables for astronomical scenes.

* For numerical simulation studies on using photonic lanterns for spectroastrometric measurements, please refer to [Kim et al. JATIS 10, 045001](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024JATIS..10d5001K/abstract).

* For laboratory spectral characterizations of 3-port photonic lanterns, please refer to [Kim et al. JATIS 10, 045004](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024JATIS..10d5004K/abstract).

* For actual photonic lantern data reduction, please check out the package [PLred](https://github.com/YooJung-Kim/PLred).

The codes for photonic integrated circuit are currently under development for open-use!
